Last Updated: [11/09/2025 8:46pm AEST]

Data We Collect

AfterLife may collect minimal server configuration data (e.g., prefixes, moderation settings).

We do not collect personal information such as email, passwords, or payment details.

How Data Is Used

Stored data is only used to provide bot functionality (e.g., remembering settings).

We do not sell or share data with third parties.

Data Retention & Deletion

Data is kept only as long as it is required for AfterLife to function.

Users or server admins may request deletion of their data by contacting the developer.

Children’s Privacy
AfterLife follows Discord’s minimum age requirements. The bot is not intended for users under that age.

Changes to Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of AfterLife means you accept the new policy.
